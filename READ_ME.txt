RUNNING THE APP (especially after downloading from GitHub)
- If you open index.html by double-clicking (file://), many browsers will block audio from playing.
- For audio to work: run a local web server in this folder, then open the URL in your browser.
  Examples:
  • Node:  npx serve
  • Python 3:  python -m http.server 8000   then open http://localhost:8000
  • VS Code: use the "Live Server" extension and "Open with Live Server"
- Or host the app on GitHub Pages; then it runs over https and audio works.

This App is still a Work in Progress!
- Currently working on Adding Stories for the Reading Section
- Next I'll be working on the "Sounds section"
- After that I'll be working on making Lessons be adaptable for the user

The Current version has the following issues:
- Japanese Translations have not been verified
- Sounds information is blank
- Practice Mode can't remember scores after closing and reopening the app
- There is no difference between Speaking and Listening lessons
- Reading sounds unnatural
