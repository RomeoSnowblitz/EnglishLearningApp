This App is still a Work in Progress!
- Currently working on Adding Stories for the Reading Section
- Next I'll be working on the "Sounds section"

- Sounds information is blank
- Practice Mode can't remember scores after closing and reopening the app
- There is no difference between Speaking and Listening lessons
- Reading sounds unnatural
